# Introduction
Night at the museum is a mobile virtual reality experience with 'information booths' showing five devices about this powerful technology. I used the Cardboard api v1.60 and Unity v5.6 for this project.  
Video by youtube channel: Gadgets HERO

# Design Process
When I started this project the Unity's youtube channel released a new training Playing Video In Unity using the new video api and I used this training with initial setup in my project. 
I downloaded a free environment form asset store and used a familiar green rect to waypoints.

# Conclusion
This VR project was the last project from first part of my Nanodegree. This two last projects boost me up on VR development. I am not a good level design, I'm programer and I know certitly exist a other easier way to design the level who I did. This was I great experience and now I'm going to extracurricular topics in my Nanodegree.
